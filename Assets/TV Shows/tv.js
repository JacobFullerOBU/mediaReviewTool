Tony's career causes him frequent rage and anxiety, and after suffering from a particularly bad panic attack, he reluctantly begins therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi. In Dr. Melfi's office, Tony slowly begins to open up about his emotional problems, even as his career continually leads him into dangerous and even life-threatening scenarios. He finds himself at odds with his wife Carmela, his uncle Junior, and other ambitious family members, as well as the Lupertazzi crime family of New York. ",

What begins as a secret fling between two fresh faced rookies evolves into a years-long journey of love, denial, and self-discovery. Over the next eight years, as they chase glory on the ice, they struggle to navigate their feelings for each other. Torn between the sport they live for and the love they can’t ignore, they must decide if there’s room in their fiercely competitive world for something as fragile – and powerful – as real love.",

        description: "This sitcom  series premiered in 1981 and changed its name every year, from 'Hong Kong 81' to 'Hong Kong 86.' It was eventually replaced by a new sitcom called 'City Stories.' A total of 1330 episodes were produced, making it the second-longest-running series in Hong Kong, after 'Come Home Love: Lo and Behold'.  Each episode of this series is inspired by current social issues, with early storylines often satirizing society's flaws. The characters, such as 'Chen Ji,' 'Mrs. Shun,' 'Uncle Mao,' 'Jue Wu Yin,' 'Miss Su,' 'A Wei,' and 'Ah Kang,' mostly hail from the grassroots, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. For example, 'Mrs. Shun,' portrayed by Lydia Shum, later became a term to describe uneducated women who follow trends blindly. 'Chen Ji,' played by Lawrence Ng, is a stockbroker who loves to show off his wealth, and his behavior typified that of many Hong Kongers, becoming a byword for the city's nouveau riche.",

Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.  A pilot episode, 'Gone in a Flash', aired as part of 'Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend' on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.  Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place 'not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.'",

He's not alone, though, because a group of small creatures called lemmings also populate the ranger's house when he is away. Because Grizzy and the lemmings are not civilized enough to live together in peace, it becomes an atmosphere of madness when the two sides try to outdo each other with tricks.",

The show's format revolves around his commentary and review of older, but unsuccessful video games which are deemed to be of particularly low-quality, unfair difficulty or poor design.  The series began as a feature on YouTube and later became a program on ScrewAttack Entertainment before moving to GameTrailers exclusively. The show was renamed The Angry Video Game Nerd to prevent any trademark issues with Nintendo and due to the fact he started reviewing games from non-Nintendo consoles such as those made by Atari and Sega.  Rolfe's character, 'The Nerd' is a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic. He derives comic appeal from excessive and inventive use of anger, profanity, and habitual consumption of alcohol while reviewing video games.",

It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life, as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor barrios. For example, it showed the impact on poor people's lives of the intermittent water supply, showing community meetings and lovers' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on, sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels.  It was considered by the Spanish edition of the magazine Rolling Stone as the 8th best show between the 100 Best TV Shows Ever in all Latin America. It is believed to be the longest telenovela ever produced in Venezuela.",

He’s a hotshot soldier from the clandestine counter-terrorist organization known as Mithril – and he’s going undercover at Kaname’s school to try and keep her safe. He may be an ace in the cockpit of an Arm Slave mech, but there’s no training in the world that could prepare him for the warzone of high school.",

        description: "How do you like Wednesday? was a Japanese television variety series that aired on the HTB network in Hokkaidō, Japan, and on other regional television networks in Japan. The program debuted on HTB on October 9, 1996. The series was one of the first local variety programs to be produced on Hokkaido; prior to this series' launch, local variety programs in Hokkaidō were virtually non-existent. The program also had a significant influence on other local programs in other regions in Japan, most notably Kwangaku! in Kansai and Nobunaga in Tokai.  The series achieved a record 18.6% viewing share on December 8, 1999, the highest share for a late-night program on a local TV station.  Production of the weekly regular series ended in September 2002, though new limited-run series were produced on average of every 18 months; the latest series was shown on HTB in late 2005, eight episodes in length.  Most of the series have been rerun under the names of Dōdeshō Returns and Suiyō Dōdeshō Classic.",

The series aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973, then returned to television for two seasons on ABC, from 1988 to 1990, retaining only Graves in the cast.
