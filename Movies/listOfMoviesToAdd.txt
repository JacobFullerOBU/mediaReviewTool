The Godfather (1972) – Practically perfect. Defines American cinema.

Citizen Kane (1941) – Overhyped? Maybe. But it changed how films are made.

Casablanca (1942) – Old Hollywood romance at its best.

Pulp Fiction (1994) – Reshaped indie film and 90s cool forever.

2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) – Visually untouchable. Kubrick was playing chess in a checkers world.

The Shawshank Redemption (1994) – IMDb’s darling and rightly so.

Apocalypse Now (1979) – War, madness, and method filmmaking on steroids.

Goodfellas (1990) – The most kinetic and quotable mob film after The Godfather.

Chinatown (1974) – Neo-noir perfection with one of the best scripts ever.

The Dark Knight (2008) – Elevated superhero films into legitimate drama territory.

Fight Club (1999) – A mind-bender that defined Gen X angst (and still sparks debates).

Psycho (1960) – Hitchcock didn’t invent horror, but he damn near perfected it.

Spirited Away (2001) – Proof animation can be as emotionally rich as any live-action drama.

The Empire Strikes Back (1980) – The rare sequel that deepened everything.

12 Angry Men (1957) – Minimalist, gripping, and still deeply relevant.
